Advantages and Disadvantages:
	The advantages to the array implementation is that printing and searching are simplier
	functions, but the disadvantage to the array implementation is the delete function
	because not only do you have to search through the array you have to then move
	all of the following elements one position down and another disadvantage is
	that an array must have a set size which could at one point be overflowed.
	The advantages to the linked list implmentation is the deleting elements. 
	The disadvantage to the inked list implementation is the searching takes slightly
	more time than that of the array because the memory is not conitguous. 

Storing in Alphabetical order:
	Advantages would be the seraching function could be made into a binary search
	to speed up the searching function to delete or find an element. 
	Disadvantages would be adding elements to the implementation because a sort function
	would always need to be preformed after the insertion of another element.
